# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic data structure topics:

[Stacks](./stacks/stacks-tutorial.md)

[Linked Lists](./linked-lists/linked-list-tutorial.md)

[Binary Search Trees (BTS)](./binary-search-trees/bst-tutorial.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
